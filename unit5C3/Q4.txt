A. What do you mean by IoC (Inversion of Control) Container?
B. What are Spring Beans?
C. What are the bean scopes available in Spring
D. What is autowiring and name the different modes of it.What are the limitations
of autowiring


A. If a class depends on another class then dependent class create the object of dependency class and use that object to call the methods
	of dependency class. But here dependency object is created manually in the main class.
	
	-> But if some external entity take care of creating an object of dependency class then we call the control is inverted which is known
		as Inversion of control. IOC states that external entity provides the dependencies to the application instead of hard coding.
		
B. Any Java class which is registered with the spring container is called Spring Bean. Basically Spring Bean is a POJO class.

	Example: Lets assume that there a class Student.java
	
	Inside applicationContext.xml file under beans tag
	
	<bean id="beanId" class="fully Qualified Class Name"/>

C. There are 4 scopes available for a bean in spring.

Basically scope is nothing but lifespan

1.singleton scope(default)
2.prototype scope
3.request scope
4.session scope

D. The process of creating association between application components is known as Wiring.

There are 2 types

1. Explicit Wiring

If we specify the association using property tag or constructer-arg tag, it is known as Explicit Wiring.

2. Auto Wiring

If Spring container associates dependencies on its own, It is known as Auto Wiring.

Limitations
------------

1. It is only used for objects not for simple value dependencies.
2. If container having multiple dependencies of same object then there will ambiguous situation.
